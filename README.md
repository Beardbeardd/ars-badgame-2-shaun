#### Kifaaya al-Ghani of Verditius - Magi

Born of noble descent in the distant lands of Araby, Kifaaya may have been a valuable wife, were she not a war orphan and, perhaps more critically, did not have The Gift. As it were, however, she found herself taken in as an apprentice of a Verditius parens instead, her relatives glad to be rid of her.

After completing the Gauntlet, she travelled towards the great city of Rome. Redcaps had brought news to the Forge during her apprenticeship of a brownie named Giacomo, a skilled tailor who cooperated with the local covenant. After convincing him to employ her, she trained at his shop, until Vardian's Tomb finally took her in as a voting member.

#### Modius Rex - Companion

Born of strong dwarven blood, this strange man spent the early years of his life tomb raiding, using his dowsing talents to find hidden treasure and tributes. Eventually his antics got him into trouble with residents of the tomb, who press-ganged him into service. Through them he managed to make a few friends in the Stonemasons guild, and bribed his way into training. Despite his bizarre and off-putting appearance, his faerie ancestry made him a natural, and he climbed the ranks until he could go no further without becoming a guildmaster. So he has returned to the tomb to help it expand, add basements to its street-level properties, and upgrade laboratory virtues.

Modius has enough valuables cached, and enough sway among the gangs of catacomb dwellers, that he is effectively Wealthy, allowing him to join the covenfolk as a Companion without adding to their seasonal expenses.
