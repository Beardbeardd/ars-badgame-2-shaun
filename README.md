#### Touch of Midas - CrTe 20 (+23) - R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual
This spell creates a roughly spherical lump of gold about six inches across. This weighs about 80 pounds, and is enough money to keepa peasant family in comfort for about 300 years.

#### Scales of Archimedes - InTe 10 (+19) - R: Per, D: Conc, T: Touch
By weighing a metal object in his hand, the caster can determine the metals that compose it, and their approximate purity.

#### Hidden Pillars - InTe 20 (+19) - R: Touch D: Conc T: Part
The caster senses how a particular section of earth and stone (up to 1000 cubic paces of earth or 100 cubic paces of stone) could be quarried or excavated in manners which would produce stable spaces or unstable spaces.

#### The Crystal Dart - MuTe 10 (+21) - Req: Rego - R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind
A 10-inch crystal dart rises from the ground at your feet, floats into the air, and speeds off like an arrow at a target that is within Voice range. It does +10 damage, and always hits its target, although it must penetrate Magic Resistance to have any real effect.

#### Supplie Iron and Rigid Rope - MuTe 10 (+21) - R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind
Makes a flexible object stiff or a stiff object flexible. Casting requisites of Forms appropriate to the materials affected are required.

#### Shaping the Earth's Form - Mu(Re)Te 20 (+21) - R: Touch D: Conc T: Part
Allows the caster to soften and rapidly reshape up to a 10 pace volume of stone so long as the caster's concentration is uninterrupted. The Rego requisite allows the caster to shape the affected mass via gestures (this does not interfere with concentration). This permits manipulations of moderate complexity (regular shapes and structures no thinner than a few inches). So long as target remains a single connected mass, all of it may continue to be reshaped. Parts of the target may be selectively "re-hardened" or "pinched off", but they cease to be affected by the spell and cannot be re-shaped after this. As the spell is range Touch, the caster must remain in contact with some portion of the mass to continue to shape any part of it. If no portion of the affected mass is within 5 paces of the caster, the spell ends.

#### Pillar of Emptiness - PeTe 15 (+19) - R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Part
The caster annihilates a straight column of stone, 13 paces in length and one pace in diameter. The column can run in any direction: vertical into the earth, horizontal through a wall, diagonally into a hill, but it must be columnar in shape.

#### The Stone Palanquin - ReTe 15 (+21) - R: Touch D: Sun T: Ind
Enchants a stone, large enough to bear the caster, to carry him along at his mental direction. The stone moves with a speed, direction, and height above the ground that he decides (maximum speed as of a galloping horse, maximum height of 10 paces above the ground).
